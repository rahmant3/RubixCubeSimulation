# RubixCubeSimulation
3D Rubix Cube (3x3) made in Processing (Java-based)

-Just trying to learn how to use Processing.

Goals:

-Make UI a little nicer/easier. For now, rotation of each face is controlled by a key press, which can be a little bit confusing when the user turns their perspective of the cube (double click will return you to normal, but still.
-Generalize to nxn cube (should be pretty simple)

-Any other optimizations that are required due to me not knowing Processing too well.

How to Use:

-Open the source files in Processing

-Make sure peasycam library is added (can be added at Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library)

-Right-click + move mouse up/down for zoom
-Left-click + move mouse to change perspective

keyboard commands:

F = turn front face CW

L = turn left face CW

B = turn back face CW

R = turn right face CW

U = turn top face CW

D = turn bottom face CW

R = reset to solved state
