# RubixCubeSimulation
3D Rubix Cube (3x3) made in Processing (Java-based): 

[Demo](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/395881)


2016-12-20: Removed mutability of objects in both the Face class and Cube class.

2016-12-16: More clean-up, UI uses arrow keys instead of mouse position. Included a help section.

2016-12-14: Cleaned up code, improved the UI (doesn't require Peasy Cam anymore)

##Goals:

-Make UI a little nicer/easier

-Generalize to nxn cube

##How to Use:
-Try it [here.](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/395881) Or,

-Open the source files in Processing and press run.

###Controls:
-Up/Down arrows moves the cube about the central vertical axis

-Left/Right arrows about the central horizontal axis

-Shift+N randomizes the cube

-Space Bar resets cube to solved

-Press the letter corresponding to the color of the face to turn that face CLOCKWISE, e.g.:

G for green

O for orange

R for red

B for blue

W for white

Y for yellow

(The color of a face is the color of its center)

-Press U to undo a move
