# RubixCubeSimulation
3D Rubix Cube (3x3) made in Processing

-Just trying to learn how to use Processing.

Goals:
-Make UI a little nicer/easier. For now, rotation of each face is controlled by a key press, which can be a little bit confusing when the user turns their perspective of the cube (double click will return you to normal, but still.
-Generalize to nxn cube (should be pretty simple)
-Any other optimizations that are required due to me not knowing Processing too well.
