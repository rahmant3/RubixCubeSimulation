# RubixCubeSimulation
3D Rubix Cube (3x3) made in Processing (Java-based)

-Just trying to learn how to use Processing.

2016-12-15: Cleaned up code, improved the UI (doesn't require Peasy Cam anymore)

Goals:

-Make UI a little nicer/easier. For now, rotation of each face is controlled by a key press, which can be a little bit confusing when the user turns their perspective of the cube (double click will return you to normal, but still.

-Generalize to nxn cube

How to Use:

-Open the source files in Processing and run (will look to put onto openprocessing.org so that this won't be necessary in the future)

Controls:
-Mouse movement from side to side moves the cube about the central vertical axis
-Mouse movement above or below the middle half of the window moves the cube about the central horizontal axis
-Shift+N randomizes the cube
-Space Bar resets cube to solved
-Press the letter corresponding to the color of the face to turn that face CLOCKWISE, e.g.:
G for green
O for orange
R for red
B for blue
W for white
Y fo yellow
(The color of a face is the color of its center)
-Press U to undo a move
